Welcome to my Github Page!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently in the process of becoming an everyday developer. Go is my language of choice. But I am willing to learn anything!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to work on small and big apps to increase my knowledge, i work every day with C#, Go, yaml, and Azure Devops.

I collaborate weekly, building a project for the future of software developers. 

I currently work as an DevOps Engineer for greymatter.io
