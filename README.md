Welcome to my Github Page!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently in the process of becoming an everyday developer. Go is my language of choice. But I am willing to learn anything!

I currently work as an DevOps Engineer for greymatter.io

I work exclusively with network meshes in kubernetes, and configuring various applications under the mesh. Including keycloak, portal, vscode, minio, jupyterhub(r), airflow, gatekeeper, gitlab and gitea, kibana, nexus, sonarqube, twistlock, anchore etc.

You can reach me by emailing me brodiep21@hotmail.com or bpeif21@gmail.com.
